Given graph - Undirected weighted graph with N nodes and M edges(no relation between them)

Spanning Tree
-> A tree in which we have n nodes and n-1 edges
-> All nodes should be reachable from each other

Sum of weights of edges of spanning tree must be minimum

Approach 1 - Prims Algorithm

We require min. heap(w, node, parent) and vis array
