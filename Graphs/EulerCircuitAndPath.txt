EULER PATH
An Euler path is a path that uses every edge in a graph with no repeats. 
Being a path, it does not have to return to the starting vertex.

EULER CIRCUIT
An Euler circuit is a circuit that uses every edge in a graph with no repeats. 
Being a circuit, it must start and end at the same vertex.

EULERâ€™S PATH AND CIRCUIT THEOREMS
-> A graph will contain an Euler path if it contains at most two vertices of odd degree.
-> A graph will contain an Euler circuit if all vertices have even degree

Time = O(V+E) | Space = O(V)
